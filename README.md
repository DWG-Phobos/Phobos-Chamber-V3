## Project Phobos

Project Phobos is the fist attempt of UDG students Marc Molas, Gerard Barragan and Jaume Ramos at making a videogame using 3js.

The game will be about escaping from an unknown location whil avoiding being caught by a dangerous hazard which would anhialate the player inmediately

This project will most likely end being a bad game, but we will try our best to avoid it with all out might!
